			<h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom:0.1rem;">In India, a yearly approximate of 8 lakh tonnes of floral waste (amounting to nearly one-third of the total solid waste) finds its way into rivers and landfills.</p>
            <p>Floral discards harbour residual pesticides and insecticides which merge with water bodies, proving to be detrimental to water quality as well as aquatic life. This consequently undermines an already fragile ecosystem.</p>  
			<p class="lead" style="margin-bottom:0.1rem;">The synthetic dyeing and textile industry is the third largest consumer of water in the world, expending nearly 2.4 trillion gallons of water a year, and effusing over 70 toxic chemicals into the hydrosphere.</p>
			<p>The synthetic dyeing process involves a lot of water, and not all places have effective means of treating the water before it goes back into the environment. Untreated water, replete with noxious additives, is perilous for oceans. Some of such chemicals don't ever degrade in water. Others that do, produce harmful substances and deplete oxygen levels as they decompose.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12 mb-2">
			<h2>Our Initiatives</h2>
            <p class="lead">Sacred offerings in temples to major water pollutants, such is the story of floral waste in India. Project Palaash tackles the problem of poor waste management in urban temples by collecting flower offerings and using them to naturally dye fabrics in a 100% sustainable manner, and providing a constant source of income and employment opportunities to people living in poor conditions.</p>  
            <h3>Goals</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Mitigate : </strong>the menace of poor waste management by upcycling seemingly unusable floral waste into 100% chemical-free and skin friendly dyes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Uplift : </strong>our community members by teaching them wide ranging skills through vocational training and capacity building.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Advocate : </strong>the merits of sustainable fashion and thus engender in the society a conscious desire to make environmentally sound choices.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Collaborate : </strong>with other Enactus teams working in similar domains in order to create a larger impact.</p>
				</li>

			<h2>Business Model</h2>
            <p class="lead">At Enactus Aryabhatta, to meet the triple bottom line is our holy grail. It is with this dynamism that we came up with Project Palaash. Under Palaash, our entrepreneurial action is cost-effective as well as sustainable. Palaash operates under a threefold business model</p>  
		  </div> 
			<div class="col-md-4 mb-3">
				<h3>Sourcing</h3>
				<p>Since the primary aim of the project is to recycle the flowers, sourcing them from temples forms the foundation of our initiative. Flowers are first segregated into different categories, then washed and dried so as to remove residual bio-waste. Petals are separated from the stalk and stem. From here, the petals move forward for the production of dyes, whereas the stem waste is put into composting.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 mb-3">
				<h3>Production</h3>
				<p>This stage encompasses the extraction of dyes out of flowers and mordanting the cloth using natural substances. We use a variety of techniques namely dip dyeing, clamping, stream print, and tie & dye to dye cotton dupattas and scarves.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 mb-3">
				<h3>Sales</h3>
				<p>In the final stage, our dupattas and scarves are labelled and packaged and set off for sale in the market Our entire business model is founded on the endeavour to install a zero waste system. We minimise the floral waste generated in temples by converting it into dyes. The floral matter remaining after the dyeing process is converted into compost, and the wastewater generated in the dyeing process is used to water plants.</p>
