			<h2>The Problem</h2>
            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0.1rem;">Unemployment</h4>
            <p class="lead">In times of economic slowdown and liquidity crisis, daily-wage and migrant workers are the hardest hit and among the first ones to be laid off by their employers. Already impoverished, this stratum of society will plunge deeper into a state of deprivation.</p>  
			<h4 style="margin-bottom:0.1rem;">Stockpiling-An Ethical Wrong</h4>
            <p class="lead">The panic ensued by the pandemic coupled with the pan-India lockdown is causing people to flock to grocery stores for daily essentials, ignoring the practice of 'social distancing' in the process. Additionally, since the supply chains are vulnerable to spikes in demand, hoarding by those who are financially well-off means shortage for people at an economic disadvantage. </p>  
            <h4 style="margin-bottom:0.1rem;">Shortfall in Delivery Services</h4>
            <p class="lead">Despite the doorstep delivery services provided by market giants such as Grofers and Big Basket, there is a stark failure to penetrate delivery services to a micro-level.</p>  
		</div>
        <div class="col-md-12 mb-2">
			<h2>Our Initiatives</h2>
            <p class="lead">Taking into consideration all the problems prevailing due to COVID-19, we came up with ‘Project Suvidha’. This project will help not only the unemployed labour of the country, but will also benefit the shopkeepers whose businesses are on a decline. We aim to achieve this through an efficient communication system constituting of local grocery stores and nearby households where people can easily order essentials.</p>  
            <h3>Goals</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Provide : </strong>A source of income to the unemployed and enable them to fetch some monetary value for themselves and their families thereby reducing their mental stress. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Connect : </strong>People living in remote areas with grocery and ration shops. They will no longer have to wait in queues or spend a large portion of their day procuring daily essentials.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Reach Out : </strong>To people with the aim of teaching them a moral message. Suvidha aims to complement and promote the practice of social distancing and staying in.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		  </div>  
		  <div class="col-md-12 mb-2">
			<h2>Community</h2>
            <p class="lead">Project Suvidha targets the rickshaw-wala community, which forms a huge chunk of unemployed people owing to the recent crisis, with the aim of providing them a means to earn regular and steady income. </p>
           </div>
		  <div class="col-md-12 mb-2">
			<h2>Business Models</h2>
            <p class="lead">The basic module of the project functions using an integrated communications system which allows both, ordering using phone calls & text services as well an application interface. Once a customer places an order, the nearest available delivery person and the local vendor simultaneously receive a unique order identification code along with the list of items required. Upon completing the delivery, a confirmation regarding the same shall be sent to the customer. To minimise human contact, all monetary transactions will be digital. Payments in case of applications will be made through an online portal whereas in case of ordering via mobile services, payment would first be made to a centralised operator, from where it would be credited to both the shopkeeper and the delivery person.</p>  
		  <div class="col-md-12 mb-2">  
			<h2 class="mb-3">Impact</h2>
			<p class="lead">Project Suvidha involves the employment of unused labour force with the objective of delivering daily essentials to people’s doorsteps, so that they have to avoid walking to their nearest store in order to purchase the required goods. Through this, Project Suvidha aims to effectuate a widespread impact both directly and indirectly.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3 style="margin-bottom:0.1rem;">Direct</h3>
					<p class="lead" >By employing rickshaw-walas, who make up a huge chunk of unemployed people in the wake of the pandemic, we will be solving the problem of structural unemployment.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3 style="margin-bottom:0.1rem;">Indirect</h3>
					<p class="lead" >By providing the facility of doorstep delivery with the help of an unused mode of transportation, Suvidha will promote the practice social distancing more efficiently. This project would substitute the problem of people gathering together at one particular place by a single person going to different places to fulfil the job, thus slowing down the spread of the disease</p>
